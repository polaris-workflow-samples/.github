| **Scan repository in an environment where build is not an option**  | This option is less accurate and should be used when you can’t build your repository | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/buildless-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/buildless-scan/) |[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/polaris-workflow-samples/buildless-scan/nodejs-npm.yml)](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/buildless-scan/actions) |                                                                                                                                                              
| **Scan repository with build as a pre-step (Recommended)** | This is the recommended way to scan. A pre build step guarantees all the compiled code and artifacts for SAST issues and SCA dependencies (including transitive) are scanned for comprehensive vulnerability detection | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/basic-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/basic-scan/) | [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/polaris-workflow-samples/basic-scan/nodejs-npm.yml)](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/basic-scan/actions) |                                                                                                                                                                      
| **Add comments to PRs for new vulnerable issues/components introduced through developer changes**  | For each new vulnerable issue or component introduced by the developer's changes, this integration adds a comment to the pull request. PR comments enables the users to quickly view, understand, and fix the issue before merging | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/pr-comments/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/pr-comments/) | [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/polaris-workflow-samples/pr-comments/nodejs-npm.yml)](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/pr-comments/actions) |

| **Import issues into GitHub Advanced Security** | This sample shows how you can post SAST,SCA issues found in the scan to Code Scanning tab in GitHub Advanced Security | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/sarif-report-upload/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/sarif-report-upload/) | [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/polaris-workflow-samples/sarif-report-upload/nodejs-npm.yml)](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/sarif-report-upload/actions) |                                                                                                                                                            
| **Perform polaris scans with Source Upload mode** | Execute Polaris SAST and SCA scans by directly uploading the source code to Polaris for analysis | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/source-upload/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/source-upload/) |  [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/polaris-workflow-samples/source-upload/nodejs-npm.yml)](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/source-upload/actions) |                                                                                                                                                                 
| **Perform a Polaris Sast Sigma Scan** | Rapid Scan Static lets Polaris users perform fast, lightweight static analysis scans to get quick feedback on new vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/sigma-rapid-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/sigma-rapid-scan/) | [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/polaris-workflow-samples/sigma-rapid-scan/nodejs-npm.yml)](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/sigma-rapid-scan/actions) |                                                                                                                                                               
| **Run scans asynchronously to avoid holding up the pipeline during scanning** | By default, the pipeline waits until the scan finishes. You can configure the workflow so the pipeline returns immediately after starting the scan. Note that post-scan options do not trigger if you choose not to wait for the scan to finish | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/async-mode/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/async-mode/) | [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/polaris-workflow-samples/async-mode/nodejs-npm.yml)](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/async-mode/actions) |
| **Pass advanced Coverity options for Polaris Scans** | To leverage advanced SAST features, you need to pass options to Coverity from Polaris Scans.
