| [**Scan repository in an environment where build is not an option**](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/install-directory-custom-paths) | This option is less accurate and should be used when you can’t build your repository | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/install-directory-custom-paths/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/install-directory-custom-paths/) |                                                                                                                                                              
| [**Scan repository with build as a pre-step (Recommended)**](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/basic-scan) | This is the recommended way to scan. A pre build step guarantees all the compiled code and artifacts for SAST issues and SCA dependencies (including transitive) are scanned for comprehensive vulnerability detection | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/basic-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/basic-scan/) |                                                                                                                                                                      
| [**Add comments to PRs for new vulnerable issues/components introduced through developer changes**](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/pr-comments) | For each new vulnerable issue or component introduced by the developer's changes, this integration adds a comment to the pull request.

| [**Run scans asynchronously to avoid holding up the pipeline during scanning**](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/async-mode) | By default, the pipeline waits until the scan finishes. You can configure the workflow so the pipeline returns immediately after starting the scan. Note that post-scan options do not trigger if you choose not to wait for the scan to finish | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/async-mode/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/async-mode/) |
| [**Pass advanced Coverity options for Polaris Scans**](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/arbitrary-params-sast) | To leverage advanced SAST features, you need to pass options to Coverity from Polaris Scans. This sample shows how you can configure Coverity options. | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/arbitrary-params-sast/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/arbitrary-params-sast/) |
| [**Pass advanced Detect options for Polaris Scans**](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/arbitrary-params-sca) | To leverage advanced SCA features, you need to pass options to Detect from Polaris Scans.
