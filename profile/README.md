| **Scan repository in an environment where build is not an option** | This option is less accurate and should be used when you canâ€™t build your repository | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/install-directory-custom-paths/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/install-directory-custom-paths/) |                                                                                                                                                              
| **Scan repository with build as a pre-step (Recommended)** | This is the recommended way to scan. A pre build step guarantees all the compiled code and artifacts for SAST issues and SCA dependencies (including transitive) are scanned for comprehensive vulnerability detection | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/basic-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/basic-scan/) |                                                                                                                                                                      
| **Add comments to PRs for new vulnerable issues/components introduced through developer changes** | For each new vulnerable issue or component introduced by the developer's changes, this integration adds a comment to the pull request. PR comments enables the users to quickly view, understand, and fix the issue before merging | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/pr-comments/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/pr-comments/) |                                                                                                                                                                     
| **Generate SARIF Report for SAST,SCA findings** | This sample shows how you can create a SARIF file for SAST, SCA issues found in the scan | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/sarif-report-upload/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/sarif-report-upload/) |                                                                                                                                                             
| **Import issues into GitHub Advanced Security** | This sample shows how you can post SAST,SCA issues found in the scan to Code Scanning tab in GitHub Advanced Security | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/sarif-report-upload/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/sarif-report-upload/) |                                                                                                                                                             
| **Perform polaris scans with Source Upload mode** | Execute Polaris SAST and SCA scans by directly uploading the source code to Polaris for analysis | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/source-upload/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/source-upload/) |                                                                                                                                                                   
| **Perform a Polaris Sca Signature Scan** | This sample shows executing a Polaris SCA signature scan | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/signature-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/signature-scan/) |                                                                                                                                                                  
| **Perform a Polaris Sast Sigma Scan** | Rapid Scan Static lets Polaris users perform fast, lightweight static analysis scans to get quick feedback on new vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/sigma-rapid-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/sigma-rapid-scan/) |                                                                                                                                                                
| **Run scans asynchronously to avoid holding up the pipeline during scanning** | By default, the pipeline waits until the scan finishes. You can configure the workflow so the pipeline returns immediately after starting the scan. Note that post-scan options do not trigger if you choose not to wait for the scan to finish | [Workflow](https://github.com/polaris-workflow-samples/async-mode/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://polaris-workflow-samples.github.io/async-mode/) |
